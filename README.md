**What This Covers:**
* [x] **Doxxing** *(Sharing someone’s private information without permission.)*
* [x] **Harassment** *(Constantly bothering, threatening, or targeting someone.)*
* [x] **Sending unwanted deliveries** *(Intentionally sending food or items to someone’s home without their consent.)*
* [x] **Racism & Hate speech** *(Saying or doing things that disrespect others for who they are.)*
* [x] **Sexual misconduct** *(Inappropriate behavior or messages, especially toward minors.)*
* [x] **Pedophilia** *(Extremely serious behavior involving minors that cannot be ignored.)*
* [x] **Scamming** *(Providing promised content or perks to a donator, then later removing or revoking them without reason.)*
